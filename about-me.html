            My name is Mike Bannoura and I am originally from Bethlehem,
            Palestine. I have lived in Denver, Colorado for 20 years, though, so
            I like to consider myself a native. I love to play billiards, and
            I’m pretty good at it (I even have a couple trophies that say
            exactly that). When I’m not playing billiards, I’m usually taking my
            bear, Aki, for a walk. I also enjoy playing golf and hanging out
            with friends. I have a Ps4 I play once a year, I am really bad at
            all games but somehow I beat all my friends I used to own 5 perfume
            stores for about 12 years, and I was doing great! Then the hailstorm
            hit, and I lost all stores. I have been helping out in the family
            business since then, working as a salesman, which is what I am good
            at, but I also found that I love working with computers and coding.
            I have dabbled in HTML while helping my family sort out their
            Shopify site, and I also have done some digital design and
            networking on my own over the years. I have always loved working in
            computers, but I am just now deciding that it is time for me to
            start a new career in coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to grill and play billiards in my spare time, in addition to
            playing with my adorable puppy Aki, the America Akita. Most of my
            days are spent doing work for school and helping out in the family
            business, although I always find time to do the things I love.
