          My name is Mike Bannoura and I am originally from Bethlehem, Palestine. I have lived in Denver, Colorado for 20 years,
          though, so I like to consider myself a native. I love to play billiards, and I’m pretty good at it (I even have a couple
          trophies that say exactly that). When I’m not playing billiards, I’m usually taking my bear, Aki, for a walk. I also
          enjoy playing golf and hanging out with friends. I have a Ps4 I play once a year, I am really bad at all games but
          somehow I beat all my friends I used to own 5 perfume stores for about 12 years, and I was doing great! Then the
          hailstorm hit, and I lost all stores. I have been helping out in the family business since then, working as a salesman,
          which is what I am good at, but I also found that I love working with computers and coding. I have dabbled in HTML while
          helping my family sort out their Shopify site, and I also have done some digital design and networking on my own over
          the years. I have always loved working in computers, but I am just now deciding that it is time for me to start a new
          career in coding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to grill and play billiards in my spare time, in addition to playing with my adorable puppy
            Aki, the America Akita. Most of my days are spent doing work for school and helping out in the family business, although
            I always find time to do the things I love.
